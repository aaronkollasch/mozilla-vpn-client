# License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this

# This file contains the strings for the MozillaVPN client.
# At the top level of this document, you must specify the categories. For each
# category, there is a list of string IDs. Each string ID can be:
# - a string: this will be the English translation of that string ID
# - an object composed of a `value` key and, optional, a `comment` key. Both
#   keys can be a string or an array of strings. The `value` contains the
#   English translation; the comment is useful to describe what the string is
#   and where it is used.
#
# Example:
#
#initialView:
#  # This is a simple string
#  getStartedButton: Get started
#
#  # StringID with a value and a comment
#  learnMore:
#    value: Learn more
#    comment: This is the `learn more` link shown in the initial view
#
#  # Multiple line string (with a multiple line comment)
#  subTitle:
#    value:
#      - A fast, secure and easy to use VPN. Built
#      - by the makers of Firefox
#    comment:
#      - Also comments can be written using
#      - multiple lines!
#
# In QML/JS, you can use the string IDs via the `VPNl18n` object and the `tr`
# method. Each string is converted in an enum composed by categoryName +
# stringId, in pascal case. For instance:
# ```
# Text {
#   text: VPNl18n.tr(VPNl18n.InitialViewSubTitle)
# ```
#
# In C++, you can do basically the same:
# ```
# QString foo =
#    L18nStrings::instance()->tr(L18nStrings::InitialViewGetStartedButton)
# ```
#
# Remember! When you change this file, you must run the
# `./scripts/generate_strings.py` script to regenerate the string files.
